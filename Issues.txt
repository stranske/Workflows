1) Clean up validate_fast.sh Phase 4 TODOs and remove project-specific references
Labels: agent:codex, enhancement, cleanup
Why
`scripts/validate_fast.sh` contains 12 TODO Phase 4 markers referencing Trend_Model_Project-specific features (SRC_FILES detection, autofix tests, coverage requirements) that are not applicable to this workflow repository. These dead code paths and stale references cause confusion and add maintenance burden.
Scope
- `scripts/validate_fast.sh` cleanup of TODO markers and project-specific detection logic.
Tasks
- Remove all TODO Phase 4 markers and their associated dead/commented code blocks.
- Remove SRC_FILES and AUTOFIX_FILES detection logic that references `src/` directory patterns not present in this repo.
- Update linting targets to use `scripts/` and `.github/` instead of `src/ tests/`.
- Replace Python package-specific validation (coverage requirements, import tests) with workflow-specific checks (actionlint, YAML validation).
- Ensure the script still runs successfully after cleanup.
Acceptance criteria
- `grep -c "TODO Phase" scripts/validate_fast.sh` returns 0.
- Script executes without errors: `bash scripts/validate_fast.sh --help` works.
- No references to `src/` directory or Trend_Model_Project-specific patterns remain.
- Validation targets are appropriate for a workflow repository (scripts/, .github/).
Implementation notes
- Keep the core validation framework intact; only remove dead code and update targets.
- Test with `bash scripts/validate_fast.sh --verbose` to verify functionality after changes.
- Preserve the intelligent change detection but update the file patterns it looks for.

2) Enable excluded Python tests by stubbing missing project-specific modules
Labels: agent:codex, enhancement, testing
Why
10 Python test files in `tests/workflows/` are excluded from CI and local runs because they import modules from Trend_Model_Project that don't exist in this repository (e.g., `scripts.mypy_return_autofix`, `scripts.fix_cosmetic_aggregate`, `scripts.update_autofix_expectations`). This represents ~50% of the Python test suite being skipped.
Scope
- Create stub modules in `scripts/` for missing imports.
- Update `pyproject.toml` to remove exclusions once stubs are in place.
- Update `.github/workflows/selftest-ci.yml` to run all tests.
Tasks
- Identify the exact imports needed by examining the excluded test files.
- Create minimal stub modules that provide the expected interfaces (functions that return sensible defaults or raise NotImplementedError).
- Remove the corresponding entries from `[tool.ruff] exclude` in pyproject.toml.
- Remove the `--ignore` flags from selftest-ci.yml Python test step.
- Run the full test suite and fix any remaining import or interface issues.
Acceptance criteria
- All 10 previously excluded test files are now included in CI runs.
- `python -m pytest tests/workflows/ -v` runs without collection errors.
- Test count increases from ~196 to include the previously skipped tests.
- CI workflow passes with expanded test coverage.
Implementation notes
- Stubs should be clearly marked as stubs (docstring explaining they are placeholders).
- Prefer minimal implementations that make tests pass over full functionality.
- If a test truly requires project-specific logic, mark it with `@pytest.mark.skip("Requires Trend_Model_Project")` rather than excluding the entire file.
