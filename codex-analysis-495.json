Additionally, the output suggests that CI failures are being handled with a fix-first strategy, as it discusses routing logic for different scenarios. However, the tasks related to adding routing logic for different scenarios and verification checking are still in progress, as the agent is actively planning and exploring how to implement these features.", "data_source": "jsonl", "input_length": 450196, "analysis_text_length": 13874, "effort_score": 75, "data_quality": "high", "session": {"event_count": 199, "message_count": 1, "command_count": 58, "file_change_count": 13, "todo_count": 0}}
