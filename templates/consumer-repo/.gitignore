# =============================================================================
# Workflows Consumer Repo - Shared Status Files
# =============================================================================
# These files are auto-generated by workflows and would cause merge conflicts
# if multiple PRs commit them. Historical data is preserved in:
# - PR comments (completion summaries)
# - Workflow artifacts (full outputs)
# - Commit messages (change descriptions)
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep this section in sync across all consumer repos.
# Run `python scripts/sync_status_file_ignores.py` from Workflows repo to sync.
# Last synced from: stranske/Workflows templates/consumer-repo/.gitignore
