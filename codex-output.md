I couldn’t identify a failing check to fix. The run is marked “cancelled” and “Failing jobs: none reported,” and there are no CI logs in the repo to inspect. I didn’t make any changes.

If you can share the failing job output (or re-run CI and paste the failure summary), I can target the fix. If you want me to try something local, tell me which job or test name to run.
