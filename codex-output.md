Added coverage for keepalive skip-count handling and refreshed the task checklist to reflect completed test work in the keepalive prompt. Changes are in `.github/scripts/__tests__/keepalive-guard-utils.test.js` and `codex-prompt.md`.

Tests:
- `node --test .github/scripts/__tests__/*.test.js`

Next steps (if you want to finish the remaining checklist items):
1) Run the full test suite used by Selftest CI.
2) Update test documentation if there’s a specific doc you want to keep in sync.
