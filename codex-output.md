I noticed unexpected local changes I didn’t make in `codex-prompt.md` (Progress 10/14→11/14 and “changed 2 file(s)”→“5 file(s)”). How would you like to proceed?

1) Keep these changes and continue  
2) Revert them  
3) Investigate further before continuing

Also, the remaining task requires editing `.github/workflows/agents-orchestrator.yml`, which is protected in this run; I’ll need explicit high‑privilege approval or a manual workflow edit.
