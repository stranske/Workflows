I reviewed the latest commit (`7f8e4ec`) and it only changes `codex-output.md` and `codex-prompt.md`. I can’t find any PR body or checklist file in this repo to update the task checkboxes as required. Where should I update the PR body (or can you handle that update)? Once that’s cleared, I’ll proceed with the first unchecked test task.
