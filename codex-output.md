I couldn’t find any CI failure details in the provided context. The run is marked “cancelled” and “Failing jobs: none reported,” and there are no logs in the repo to pinpoint a root cause. Without a failing job or log output, I can’t make a targeted fix.

If you can share the failing job name and the relevant log excerpt (or rerun the CI and provide the failure output), I can take the next step.
