I don’t have any failing job details to act on. The run was cancelled and the metadata says “Failing jobs: none reported,” so there’s no actionable signal to fix.

If you can share the CI log excerpt or the specific failing check name, I can target a minimal fix. If you just want a sanity check rerun, the smallest local verification would be whatever job previously failed (once identified).
