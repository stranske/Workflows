I couldn’t identify any failing check to fix from the local context. The run summary says “Conclusion: cancelled” and “Failing jobs: none reported,” and there are no CI logs in the workspace to inspect. Without a concrete failure, I don’t have a targeted change to make.

If you can share the failing job name and log excerpt, I can take another pass. If you want me to attempt a local repro anyway, tell me which check to run.
