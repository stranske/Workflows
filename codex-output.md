I’m blocked by repo policy: the only remaining task requires editing `.github/workflows/agents-orchestrator.yml`, which is protected unless `agent-high-privilege` is explicitly approved. How would you like to proceed—should I draft the exact patch for a human to apply, or can you grant a high-privilege run?
