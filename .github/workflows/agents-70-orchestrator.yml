name: Agents 70 Orchestrator

# DISABLED: This workflow experiences startup_failure due to file size (155KB).
# The full orchestrator functionality remains operational in the source repository:
# https://github.com/stranske/Trend_Model_Project
#
# Resolution options tracked in Issue #2:
# - Split into reusable workflows to reduce file size
# - Extract inline scripts to .github/scripts/ files
# - Use workflow_call delegation pattern
#
# Keepalive functionality for this repository is currently paused.
# PRs require manual iteration until this is resolved.
