# Dependabot configuration for Workflows repo
# 
# ARCHITECTURE:
# 1. Dependabot updates pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies].dev
# 2. A post-merge workflow syncs pyproject.toml -> autofix-versions.env
# 3. maint-52 syncs autofix-versions.env -> consumer repos
#
# This keeps the .env file (source of truth for consumers) automatically updated.
